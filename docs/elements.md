# Geomagnetic Elements



## Obsrio
Elements generated by observatories running the Obsrio data acquisition system.

### Acquired elements

- 10Hz volt + bin
  - U, V, W

- 1Hz engineering units
  - F, T1-4

### Derived variation

- 1Hz engineering units

  - U, V, W conversion from 10Hz volt+bin to 1Hz engineering units

    uses instrument metadata from `geomagio.Metadata.get_instrument`

- 1 minute engineering units

  - T1-4

    uses `geomagio.algorithm.FilterAlgorithm` to filter from 1Hz to 1 minute.


## PCDCP
Elements generated by observatories running the PCDCP data acquisition system.

### Acquired elements

- 1Hz legacy engineering units

  - H, E, Z, F

- 1 minute legacy engineering units

### Derived variation

- 1Hz engineering units

  - U, V, W, F copied from legacy engineering units

- 1 minute engineering units

  - T1-4 copied from legacy engineering units


## Common

Derived elements calculated for all observatories.

## Derived variation

- 1Hz engineering units
  - H, D, X, Y

    uses `geomagio.algorithm.XYZAlgorithm` to rotate coordinates from observatory (U,V) to magnetic (H,D) and geographic (X,Y).

- 1 minute engineering units

  - U, V, W, F, T1-4

    uses `geomagio.algorithm.FilterAlgorithm` to filter from 1Hz to 1 minute.


## Derived adjusted

- 1Hz engineering units
  - X, Y, Z, F

    uses `geomagio.algorithm.AdjustedAlgorithm` with per-observatory matrices stored in filesystem.

- 1 minute engineering units

    uses `geomagio.algorithm.FilterAlgorithm` to filter from 1Hz to 1 minute.
