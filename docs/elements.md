## Common

Derived elements calculated for all observatories.

### Derived variation

- 1Hz engineering units
  - D, X, Y

    uses `geomagio.algorithm.XYZAlgorithm` to rotate coordinates from observatory (U,V) to magnetic D and geographic (X,Y).

  - G

    uses `geomagio.algorithm.DeltaFAlgorithm` to generate delta F from U,V,W,F.

- 1 minute/hour/day engineering units

  - U, V, W, F, T1-4

    uses `geomagio.algorithm.FilterAlgorithm` to filter from 1Hz to 1 minute or 1 minute to 1 hour/day.

  - D, X, Y

    uses `geomagio.algorithm.XYZAlgorithm` to rotate coordinates from observatory (U,V) to magnetic D and geographic (X,Y).

  - G

    uses `geomagio.algorithm.DeltaFAlgorithm` to generate delta F from U,V,W,F.

  - H_SQ, H_SV, H_Dist
