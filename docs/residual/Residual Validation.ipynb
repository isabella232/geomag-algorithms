    "Notes about underlying sytax of diagram:\n",
    "* Tools are displayed as rectnagules\n",
    "* Objects are displayes as ovals\n",
    "* Attributes are dispayed without an encapsulating shape\n",
    "* Ratio notation indicates the amount of an object contained within another object, or the amount of objects required to utilize a tool\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spreadsheet Absolutes Factory:\n",
    "* Creates readings from legacy residual spreadsheets\n",
    "* One spreadsheet will contain one reading, thus only one reading will result from utilizing the tool\n",
    "* Allows for two types of precision: DM(degrees-minutes) or DMS(degrees-minutes-seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Web Absolutes Factory:\n",
    "* Pulls historical absolutes from the team's webservice\n",
    "* Number of output readings depend on the time range specified\n",
    "* Historical measurements will pertain to the Null method(no residuals, less measurements)\n",
    "* Precision(DM or DMS) is determined by instrument precision specified by employees inputing observations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation:\n",
    "* Takes one reading as input and produces absolute values\n",
    "* Requires that measurements contain ordinates(magnetometer readings) for each measurement excluding mark measurements\n",
    "* The calculate method wraps together several helper methods to store absolutes within the input residual object\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calfile factory:\n",
    "* Takes any number of absolutes and produces a cal file\n",
    "* This method has no part in the calculation of absolutes\n",
    "* Files of this format are used by data processors to produce Quasi-Definitive and Definitive data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading:\n",
    "* Absolutes: List of 3 Absolute Objects\n",
    "* Azimuth: account for location of pier(magnetic reference point for observers, optional)\n",
    "* Hemisphere: 1 or -1 depending on observatory location\n",
    "* Measurements: List of Measurement Objects(optional)\n",
    "    * 26 Measurements for residual method\n",
    "    * 12 Measurements for null method\n",
    "* Metadata: defined for each observatory/set of measurements\n",
    "* Pier correction: account for correction in instrument orientation(optional)\n",
    "* Scale value: determined inside of calculations if not already specified(optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measurement:\n",
    "* Measurement type: Object holding supplemental information to calclulations\n",
    "* Angle: Observed value from instrument\n",
    "* Time: Time of observation from instrument\n",
    "* Ordinates: h, e, z and f values taken from magnetometer recordings(optional, but required for calculations)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measurement Type:\n",
    "* String identifier of measurement category(mark up/down, north up/down, west up/down, etc.)\n",
    "* Supplements for calculation:\n",
    "    * Direction\n",
    "    * Shift\n",
    "    * Meridian\n",
    "* Categorical sets\n",
    "    * Mark types\n",
    "    * Declination types\n",
    "    * Inclination types"
